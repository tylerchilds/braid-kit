Download a kml file from google maps, drag and drop it onto Smugoogle

@ Ty
" This converts google data into a more open and easier to work with shape of data

When the map drops, locations open up as question marks

@ Ty
" These locations meant something in google, but aren't fully Smugoogle-ized yet

After selecting a question mark, a drawer appears with location information.

@ Ty
" Some location information is already populated, but we need to associate SmugMug galleries.

At the end of the drawer is the gallery section, "No Galleries Associated, add one?"

@ Ty
" By adding a gallery, we're able to drill into available Smugmug resources

A modal appears with a preview window at the top and a treeview below to browse.
